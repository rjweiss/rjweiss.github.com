This tutorial was written with researchers in mind, particularly social scientists who work with data analysis.  The goal is to get started with writing Python scripts to retrieve content from webpages programmatically (e.g. "page/screen scraping").

The original audience for this tutorial was the Very Applied Methods workshop in the Department of Political Science at [Stanford University][stanford].  Most participants in this workshop have had some experience with data analysis with tools such as `R`, `MATLAB`, or analysis software such as SPSS or Stata.  Others have taken undergraduate computer science courses, have put together a simple webpage and have some familiarity with basic web architecture concepts such as HTML, or `ssh` into the Stanford servers.

But most of this material will be presented without the assumption of a deep understanding of computers, software, or even web architecture in general.  However, comparisons to `R` and general computer science concepts will be referenced.  Reproducible code examples...
