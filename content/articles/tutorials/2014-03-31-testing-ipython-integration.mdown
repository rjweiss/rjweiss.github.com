Summary: How easy is it to integrate IPython notebooks in a pelican blog?

In this post, I'm (selfishly) testing the integration between pelican and `IPython` notebooks.

I've been meaning to do this for awhile, since I have quite a few `R` and `Python` tutorials on a variety of subjects written up as `IPython` notebooks, my distribution platform of choice.

I was having trouble getting the `pelican-bootstrap3` theme to play nicely with the `liquid-tags` pelican plugin.  I have to give a hat-tip to [Kyle Cranmer][cranmer] who posted his [solution][cranmerhack] (involves chopping up the `_nb_header.html` and creating a `_nb_header_minimal.html`, which is referred to in your `pelicanconf.py` as `EXTRA_HEADER` instead).  

It's crazy to see someone else with a similar workflow!  I only discovered his work since I was having *the worst time ever* trying to get pelican to play nicely with notebooks.

His hack does the job, and now the notebooks are more nicely styled than without the additional css, but it makes me feel a little leery since it has the feel of something that will break with an update.  Oh well; that's what you get when you use open-source projects.

Below the line is an example of an ipython notebook embedded in a pelican article.  It's as simple as creating a notebook and referring to \{% notebook demonstration.ipynb % \} in the article post.
