Title: Getting starting with Python

This tutorial was written with researchers in mind, particularly social scientists who work with data analysis.  The goal is to get started with writing Python scripts to complete tasks that are helpful for data gathering, preprocessing, and analysis.

The original audience for this tutorial was the Very Applied Methods workshop in the Department of Political Science at [Stanford University][stanford].  Most participants in this workshop have had some experience with data analysis with tools such as `R`, `MATLAB`, or analysis software such as SPSS or Stata.  Others may have taken undergraduate computer science courses.  

However, this material will be presented without the assumption of a deep understanding of computers, software, or even data analysis in general.  There are any number of tutorials out there that can get you working with Python, but most of them assume the reader has the vocabulary to understand basic computing concepts. 

0. What exactly is Python?

1. Getting Python working in your environment
	- Installation instructions
	- Integrated Development Enviroment (IDE) options (Canopy)
	- Python distributions (standard and Enthought)

2. Starting a project in Python
	- Package installer (`easy_install` and `pip`)
	- Virtual environments (`virtualenv`)
	- Managing dependencies (`pip freeze` and `requirements.txt`)
	- Style guides (`PEP8`, Google style guide)
	- `IPython` and notebooks
	
3. Basic Python
	- Run your code interactively
	- Run your code as a script
	- Data types and collections
	- Other tutorials and resources	on the web
