This tutorial was written with researchers in mind, particularly social scientists who work with data analysis.  The goal is to get started with writing Python scripts to complete tasks that are helpful for data gathering, preprocessing, and analysis.

The original audience for this tutorial was the Very Applied Methods workshop in the Department of Political Science at [Stanford University][stanford].  Most participants in this workshop have had some experience with data analysis with tools such as `R`, `MATLAB`, or analysis software such as SPSS or Stata.  Others have taken undergraduate computer science courses.  Much of this material will be presented without the assumption of a deep understanding of computers, software, or even data analysis in general.  However, comparisons to `R` and general computer science concepts will be referenced.
