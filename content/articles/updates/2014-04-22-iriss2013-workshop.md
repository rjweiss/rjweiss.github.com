Summary: Materials from the 2013 Mozilla Festival workshop on the shell and text analysis

The [Institute of Research in Social Science][iriss] at Stanford has been offering a [Computational Social Science short course][css] for the past few summers.

Last year, I gave a workshop introducing the shell and basic text analysis in Python.

Slides and instructional materials are all located here: [http://www.rebeccaweiss.info/text-iriss2013/][cssworkshop]

I will probably be revising those materials into a more general set of text tutorials at some point.
