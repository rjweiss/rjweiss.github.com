Summary: Intro to Python materials from the Very Applied Methods workshop

The [Department of Political Science][polisci] at Stanford started the [Very Applied Methods workshop series][vam].

I gave a workshop introducing Python with a brief application of simple page scraping.  

The slides and related materials are all located here (note the capitalization): [http://www.rebeccaweiss.info/VAM-Python][vamworkshop]


I will probably be revising those materials into a more general set of Python tutorials at some point.
