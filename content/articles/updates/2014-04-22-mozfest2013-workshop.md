Summary: Materials from the 2013 Mozilla Festival workshop on simple text analysis

I gave a workshop on how to work with text as data at the 2013 [Mozilla Festival][mozfest].

Slides and instructional materials (`R` and `Python`) are all located here: [http://www.rebeccaweiss.info/mozfest2013/][mozfeststuff]

I will probably be revising those materials into a more general set of text tutorials at some point.
