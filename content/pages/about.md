I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Communication][comm] at [Stanford University][stanford]. 

I am also a member of the [Political Communication Laboratory][pcl]. 

In my research, I use a broad array of quantitative methods, mostly survey experiments as well as computational approaches towards text analysis.

This site is a work-in-progress.  This is basically a warning.  I don't guarantee that anything on here won't be modified whenever I feel like it.  This goes doubly for the tutorials, which are always being revised after I get feedback.
