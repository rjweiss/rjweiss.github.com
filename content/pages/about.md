I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Communication][comm] at [Stanford University][stanford]. 

I am also a member of the [Political Communication Laboratory][pcl]. 

My dissertation focuses on political communication, with extra emphasis on mass polarization and the manner in which media coverage is distorted from reality.  

In my research, I use a broad array of quantitative methods, mostly survey experiments as well as computational approaches towards text analysis.
