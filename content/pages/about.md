Title: Who am I?
Slug: about

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Communication][comm] at [Stanford University][stanford].  I am also a member of the [Political Communication Laboratory][pcl].  In my research, I use a broad array of quantitative methods, mostly survey experiments as well as computational approaches towards text analysis.

I am also a 2014-2015 fellow at the [Brown Institute for Media Innovation][brown] and a 2013-2015 fellow at the [Berkman Center for Internet and Society][berkman].  I work on the [Media Cloud][mediacloud] project, a joint collaboration between the [Center for Civic Media][civic] at the [MIT Media Lab][medialab] and Berkman.

This site is a work-in-progress.  This is basically a warning.  I don't guarantee that anything on here won't be modified whenever I feel like it.  This goes doubly for the tutorials, which are always being revised after I get feedback.
